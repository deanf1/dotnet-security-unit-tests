To deploy the web application:

	- Run the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt as administrator
	- Navigate to the project folder (where this file is located)
	- Run either DeployWebAppDotNet451.bat to run in .NET 4.5.1 , DeployWebAppDotNet452.bat to run in .NET 4.5.2, or DeployWebAppDotNet46.bat to run in .NET 4.6
	  (Note: The major fixes happen in 4.5.2, and there is no discernable difference between running in 4.5.2 and 4.6)
	- Press 'q' to close the server when finished
