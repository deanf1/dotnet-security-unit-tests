To deploy the web application:

	- Run the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt as administrator
	- Navigate to the project folder (where this file is located)
	- Run either DeployWebAppDotNet451.bat to run in .NET 4.5.1 , DeployWebAppDotNet452.bat to run in .NET 4.5.2, or DeployWebAppDotNet46.bat to run in .NET 4.6
	  (Note: The major fixes happen in 4.5.2, and there is no discernable difference between running in 4.5.2 and 4.6)
	- Press 'q' to close the server when finished
	
To run all tests programmatically:

	Make sure you have Python installed and in your path!

	- Download ChromeDriver at https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
	- Place the executable in the project base directory (or add it to your path manually)
	- Deploy the web app
	- Run RunAllTests.bat
